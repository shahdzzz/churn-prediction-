# Customer Churn in Telecom Analysis and Prediction

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for analyzing and predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. We have explored the dataset, applied various machine learning models, and evaluated their performance based on different metrics such as ROC AUC, accuracy, precision, and F1 score. Below is a summary of the model results:

| Algorithm              | ROC AUC | Accuracy | Precision | F1 Score |
|------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Random Forest          | 86.97   | 91.96    | 88.23     | 91.21    |
| Logistic Regression    | 83.93   | 90.66    | 89.02     | 88.74    |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 81.57   | 77.40    | 87.46     | 86.77    |
| Kernel SVM             | 79.27   | 86.18    | 80.52     | 86.63    |
| Gaussian NB            | 76.87   | 86.19    | 91.32     | 82.23    |

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to provide insights into customer churn patterns and build predictive models to anticipate and mitigate churn.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis and prediction.
- `notebooks/`: Here, you will find Jupyter notebooks that walk through the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building process.
- `models/`: This directory includes the trained machine learning models, which can be used for prediction.
- `src/`: You'll find source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in this directory.
- `results/`: This directory stores the results of the model evaluations and any other relevant output files.

## Getting Started


1. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the EDA and model building process.


## Usage

You can use the provided notebooks and code as a starting point for your own customer churn analysis and prediction project. Feel free to adapt and extend the code to suit your needs.
